//! Embedding identity — the single source of truth describing which embedding
//! model/space a set of stored vectors belongs to.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//! The vector store is a cache of embeddings produced by ONE embedding model.
//! If a version upgrade changes the embedding model (or its output dimension or
//! provider) while keeping the same vector length, cosine similarity between a
//! query embedded with the NEW model and vectors embedded with the OLD model is
//! mathematically meaningless — the store returns confident-but-wrong results.
//!
//! Nothing in the freshness path (`tracker::detect_changes` on mtime/size/
//! chunker_version, or `shard_file::open_current` on dim+stamp) knows which model
//! produced a vector, so a same-dimension model swap slips through undetected and
//! retrieval silently degrades until a manual rebuild.
//!
//! `EmbeddingIdentity` closes that hole: it is stamped into the repo DB
//! (`index_meta[EMBEDDING_IDENTITY_KEY]`) at index-commit time, mixed into the
//! persisted shard's `content_stamp`, and carried on every resident shard so the
//! query path can validate the space before searching.
//!
//! ## Source of truth
//! An identity is ALWAYS derived from the real embedding client used for the
//! operation (`from_client`) — the same `VoyageClient` that embeds a query is the
//! one whose identity describes that query's vector space; the same `self.voyage`
//! that re-embeds during an index run is the one whose identity is committed.
//! There is deliberately no config-derived constructor: a second normalization
//! path would risk diverging from the client actually used.
