# Ask Matt

You don't remember every skill, so ask.

A **flow** is a path through the skills. Most paths run along one **main flow**, and several **on-ramps** merge onto it. Everything else is maintenance, standalone, or one of two layers that run underneath: **vocabulary**, and **platform knowledge**.

## The main flow: idea → ship

The route most work travels. You have an idea and want it built.

1. **`/grill-with-docs`** sharpens the idea by interview. Start here whenever you are **working in a working directory**: it's stateful, retaining what it learns in `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs. (No working directory? Use `/grill-me` instead, covered under Standalone. Both run the same `/grilling` primitive; `grill-with-docs` is the one that leaves a paper trail, which makes it the better of the two whenever a repo is there to leave it in.)
2. **Branch: is this initiative-scale?** If the idea is bigger than one feature, because several specs will grow out of it or someone outside engineering needs to read and sign off on the *why*, then **`/to-prd`** turns the grilled thread into a PRD: why it's worth building, for whom, and what success looks like, written in the `CONTEXT.md` vocabulary so a CEO, BA, and engineer read it the same way. Every spec that grows out of the initiative references it. A single well-scoped feature **skips this step**, and `/to-prd` itself refuses an unripe idea, routing you back to `/grill-with-docs` rather than interviewing a PRD into existence.
3. **Branch: can you settle every question in conversation?** If a question needs a runnable answer (state, business logic, a UI you have to see), detour through a prototype, bridged by **`/handoff`** in both directions (a prototype lives in its own directory, which is exactly what `/handoff` is for; see Phase boundaries):
   - **`/handoff`** out, then open a fresh session against that file,
   - **`/prototype`** to answer the question with throwaway code,
   - **`/handoff`** back what you learned, and reference it from the original idea thread.
4. **Branch: is this a multi-session build?**
   - **Yes** → **`/to-spec`** (turn the thread into a spec), then **`/to-tickets`** to split it into tracer-bullet tickets, each declaring its **blocking edges**. On a local tracker that's one file per ticket under `.scratch/<feature>/issues/`, worked blockers-first by hand; on a real tracker the edges become native blocking links, so any ticket whose blockers are done can be grabbed: kick off **`/implement`** per ticket, **`/clear`ing context between each one**. Each ticket is self-contained, so the last one's context is disposable.
   - **No** → **`/implement`** right here, in the same context window.

   Either way, **`/implement`** builds each issue by driving **`/tdd`** internally (one red-green slice at a time), then closes out by running **`/code-review`**, a two-axis review (Standards + Spec) of the diff, before committing. Reach for **`/tdd`** on its own when you just want to build a concrete behaviour test-first without a full spec, and **`/code-review`** on its own whenever you want to review a branch or PR against a fixed point.

   Where that building happens is **`/use-git-worktree`**: a worktree under `.worktrees/` on a `feat/` or `fix/` branch, so the main checkout keeps its branch and its uncommitted state. It is model-invoked and fires **per change rather than per step**, so it lands here only because this is where code first gets written; it applies just as much to a fix that arrives through `/diagnosing-bugs` or a refactor nobody wrote a ticket for. One-line and single-file edits skip it, and so does any change you have said to make on the current branch.

   **`/pr`** is the final presentation layer when the finished change needs a pull request body. It takes the summary from the issue or spec rather than inventing one from the diff, shows the smallest useful view of the change, pairs before and after evidence, and states the merge danger. It is model-invoked and belongs after implementation and review, not as another step that changes the code.

### Context hygiene

Keep steps 1-4 in **one unbroken context window** (don't compact or clear until after `/to-tickets`) so the grilling, PRD, spec, and tickets all build on the same thinking. Each `/implement` then starts fresh, working from the ticket.

The limit on this is the **[smart zone](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/smart-zone)**: the window (~150k tokens on state-of-the-art models) within which the model still reasons sharply. If a session approaches it before `/to-tickets`, don't push on degraded; `/compact` at the nearest phase boundary and carry on (see Phase boundaries).

## On-ramps

A starting situation that generates work, then merges onto the main flow.

- **Bugs and requests piling up** → **`/triage`**. It moves issues through triage roles and produces agent-ready issues, which **`/implement`** later picks up.

  Triage is only for issues **you didn't create**: bug reports, incoming feature requests, anything that arrives raw. Tickets that `/to-tickets` produced are already agent-ready, so **don't triage them**.

- **Something's broken** → **`/diagnosing-bugs`**. For the hard ones: the bug that resists a first glance, the intermittent flake, the regression that crept in between two known-good states. It refuses to theorise until it has a **tight feedback loop** (one command that already goes red on *this* bug), then fixes with a regression test. Its post-mortem hands off to **`/improve-codebase-architecture`** when the real finding is that there's no good seam to lock the bug down.

- **A huge, foggy effort: a greenfield project or a huge feature build, too big for one session** → **`/wayfinder`**, the most cognitively demanding flow here. When the way from here to the destination isn't visible yet, it charts a **shared map** of **decision tickets** on the issue tracker and resolves them one at a time, producing **decisions, not deliverables**, until the fog is pushed back and the way is clear. Where **`/grill-with-docs`** sharpens an idea you can hold in one session, wayfinder is for the idea you can't, and it's slower and denser, so save it for exactly that, never a well-scoped feature.

  When the map clears, **it hands off, it doesn't build**: merge onto the main flow at **`/to-spec`**, which collapses the map's linked decisions into a buildable plan, then `/to-tickets` and `/implement` as usual. Looping the map straight into `/implement` skips that collapse and throws the linked detail away, so go straight to `/implement` only when the effort turned out genuinely small.

- **Another codebase already solved this** → **`/port-from-repo`**. You saw a capability working somewhere else, in an open-source project, a sample app, or another repo of your own, and you want it here. It reads the source as a **primary source**, then runs `/grilling` on the question *should we bring this over at all*, which routinely cuts the scope to a fraction of what the source built. It then builds what survives itself, running `/tdd` per slice and closing out with `/code-review`, ending where `/implement` does rather than handing off to it.

  **Adapt, don't transplant** is the whole discipline: what crosses over is the approach, not the expression, because the source's dependency graph, error convention and platform assumptions are not yours. Reach for **`/research`** instead when you want to understand another codebase with no intention of building from it.

## Codebase health

Not feature work, just upkeep.

- **`/improve-codebase-architecture`** runs whenever you have a spare moment to keep the codebase good for agents to operate in. It surfaces **deepening opportunities**; picking one _generates an idea_ you can take into the main flow at `/grill-with-docs`. It's the survey that finds the candidates; **`/codebase-design`** (below) is the bench you design the chosen one on.
- **`/retro`** reads a completed coding session and finds changes that would improve the next run: navigation pointers, automated checks, coding standards, global instructions, tool economy, and information access. It recommends candidates in severity order and stops; the resulting work enters the main flow separately.

## Vocabulary underneath

Two model-invoked references that run *beneath* the other skills, each the single source of truth for its vocabulary. Reach for them directly when the **words**, not the process, are the problem; or let the skills above pull them in.

- **`/domain-modeling`**: sharpen the project's *domain* language: challenge a fuzzy term, resolve an overloaded word ("account" doing three jobs), record a hard-to-reverse decision as an ADR. It's the active discipline `/grill-with-docs` drives to keep `CONTEXT.md` a clean glossary.
- **`/codebase-design`** is the deep-module vocabulary (module, interface, depth, seam, adapter, leverage, locality) for designing a module's *shape*: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface at a clean seam. `/tdd` and `/improve-codebase-architecture` both speak it.

## Platform knowledge

Five model-invoked references for when the codebase is **Kotlin Multiplatform / Compose Multiplatform**: `/kmp-module-setup`, `/kmp-ios-integration`, `/compose-multiplatform-ui`, `/kmp-test-seams`, `/kmp-release-and-publish`. Like the vocabulary layer, they run *beneath* the flow rather than as a step in it: the model reaches for them as the work demands, and `/kmp-test-seams` is the one that sits directly under a flow step, supplying `/tdd` with the platform half of the loop. Reach for them directly when the **platform**, not the process, is what you're stuck on.

Read [references/platform-knowledge.md](references/platform-knowledge.md) for what each one covers.

## Phase boundaries

A **phase** is a chunk of work inside a session: the grilling, the implementation, the QA. At the **boundary** between two of them you have five options, and picking between them is the fuzziest decision in this whole map:

- **Continue**: stay put. Costs nothing, loses nothing.
- **`/clear`**: empty the window, when nothing here matters to what's next.
- **`/handoff`** writes a portable markdown file. Narrow: only for a **new harness**, a **new directory**, a **colleague**, or forking a side task **mid-phase**. What it buys is portability.
- **Subagent**: send a tightly-scoped task to its own window and get a report back.
- **`/compact`** compresses this context and seeds a fresh session with it. The **default**, at the bottom of the tree rather than the first reach.

Read [references/phase-boundaries.md](references/phase-boundaries.md) for the ordered tree: the five questions, the reasoning behind each branch, and why the primary-source cost makes **Continue** the one to rule out first. Make the decision **at** a boundary; mid-phase, continue or split the rest into subagents.

## Standalone

Off the main flow entirely.

- **`/grill-me`**: the same relentless interview as `/grill-with-docs`, but **stateless**: it saves nothing locally and builds no `CONTEXT.md`. Reach for it when you are **not working in a working directory** (sharpening a plan, a design, a piece of writing, anything with no repo under it). If you are in a working directory, use `/grill-with-docs` instead: it runs the same interview and leaves a paper trail, so it is strictly the better one.
- **`/grilling`** is the interview primitive itself: rounds, the frontier, facts are the agent's job and decisions are yours. `/grill-me` and `/grill-with-docs` are the two named ways in, and `/triage`, `/wayfinder` and `/improve-codebase-architecture` all run it internally. Reach for it directly only when you want the interview with no wrapper around it.
- **`/resolving-merge-conflicts`** works an in-progress merge or rebase conflict hunk by hunk, resolving by **intent** traced to each side's primary source rather than by picking lines, then finishes the operation. It never runs `--abort`. Standalone and off every flow: reach for it when you are already mid-conflict.
- **`/prototype`** is a small, throwaway program that answers one design question: does this state model feel right, or what should this UI look like. Throwaway is a constraint on how the code is written, not a promise to destroy it: the answer folds into the real code, and the prototype itself is kept as a **primary source** on a `prototype/<name>` branch out of main, pointed at from the implementation issue. It's the detour in step 2 of the main flow, but reach for it any time a design question is hard to settle on paper.
- **`/research`**: delegate reading legwork to a **background agent**: it investigates a question against **primary sources**, then leaves a cited Markdown file in the repo. Keep working while it reads. The file it produces is something to take *into* the main flow at `/grill-with-docs`, since research feeds the thinking rather than replacing it.
- **`/to-questionnaire`** comes in when the thing blocking you isn't in your head or the codebase but in **someone else's**, and it writes them a questionnaire to fill in. It's the inverse of `/grill-me`: instead of interviewing you about the subject, it interviews you about the **send** (who it's going to, what you need back) and aims the questions at the gap. What comes back is material for `/grill-with-docs` or `/to-spec`.
- **`/wizard`** is for the steps only a **human** can take: provisioning infrastructure, setting up credentials or CI secrets, clicking through an unfamiliar third-party dashboard, running a one-off migration or cutover. It generates an interactive bash script that opens each URL, captures each value, and writes it into `.env` and GitHub secrets, so the procedure stops being something you re-explain to an agent every time. Model-invoked, so the agent reaches for it the moment it hits a wall only you can pass. If the agent could just do it itself, it should; this is for where a human is genuinely in the loop.
- **`/wait-what`** is the corrective for a message that didn't land. Use it mid-conversation, inside any other skill, and the agent re-pitches what it just said with the context you were missing, in plain English, using the `CONTEXT.md` vocabulary. It works after the fact; `/grill-with-docs` is the upfront cure, because a shared language agreed early is what stops the jargon arriving at all.
- **`/teach`**: learn a concept over multiple sessions, using the current directory as a stateful workspace.
- **`/writing-for-agents`** is the reference for writing documents agents consume: skills, AGENTS.md, pointed-at docs.
- **`/unslop`** is the prose half of the same job: cutting the AI tells out of a README, a PR description, release notes, an essay, then checking a voice survived the cutting, since beige reads as machine-made just as loudly as florid does. It sets the **register** first (reference, argument, conversation, instruction), because the voice half is wrong in a config doc, and it never changes what a sentence claims without telling you, either flagging the problem or writing the missing explanation and marking it inline as its own inference. Model-invoked, so the agent reaches for it as prose gets written; reach for it directly on any draft about to be published. The two are **layered rather than alternatives**: `/writing-for-agents` owns the structure of a document an agent reads, `/unslop` owns the prose inside it, and for an agent-facing doc you want the structural pass first.

## Precondition

**`/setup-osxsystem-skills`**: run before your first engineering flow to configure the issue tracker, triage labels, and doc layout the other skills assume. Custom issue trackers also work.
