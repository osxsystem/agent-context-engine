//! Process-per-project WORKER-side helpers: idle tracking + graceful self-exit.
//!
//! A worker process serves exactly one repo (see `main::run_worker`). To make
//! "scale-to-zero" real, the worker must release everything — RocksDB handle,
//! watcher, resident shard — when it stops being used. It does that by EXITING
//! after an idle window, which lets the OS reclaim all of it at once. The router
//! respawns on the next request.
//!
//! Two pieces live here:
//! - [`IdleTracker`] + [`with_idle_tracking`]: an axum middleware layer that
//!   stamps "last activity = now" on every request, so the watchdog can tell
//!   when the worker has been quiet long enough to exit.
//! - [`spawn_idle_watchdog`]: the background task that performs the graceful
//!   shutdown SEQUENCE when the idle window elapses.
//!
//! ## Why the shutdown SEQUENCE matters (LOCK-race correctness)
//!
//! RocksDB holds an EXCLUSIVE per-directory LOCK. The crucial, measured fact:
//! on Windows that LOCK is released by **process exit** (the OS reclaims the
//! file handle), NOT by dropping the `Surreal<Db>` handle in-process — a
//! store-level test confirmed an in-process drop leaves the LOCK held for >30s.
//! So the watchdog's `close_repo_db` + `clear_repo_index` are about an ORDERLY
//! teardown (cancel the run, abort any migration, drain the pipeline under the
//! per-repo lock so nothing is half-written), while the actual LOCK release
//! comes from the `std::process::exit(0)` that follows.
//!
//! The respawn-safety guarantee is therefore NOT "drop releases the LOCK before
//! exit". It is the pair: (1) the router's `Child::try_wait` confirm-dead never
//! spawns a replacement while this pid is alive — so the new worker's `open_db`
//! only begins after this process has exited and the OS has begun releasing the
//! handle; and (2) `open_db`'s 30s LOCK-drain retry rides out any residual
//! OS-level drain after exit (measured 7s+ under Defender). The 500ms pause
//! before exit is a probability-reducer, not a correctness requirement.
