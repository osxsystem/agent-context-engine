//! Translate one [`IndexReadiness`] decision into what the REST search endpoint
//! must do — kept OUT of both `readiness.rs` (which owns the policy) and
//! `server.rs` (which owns HTTP plumbing) so each stays readable.
//!
//! ## Why this is a pure function over an inline match in the handler
//! `post_query` and `run_codebase_retrieval` must degrade identically; the only
//! legitimate difference is the SHAPE of the degrade (JSON vs prose). Expressing
//! the REST shape as a value makes that mapping unit-testable without booting
//! axum or reaching a live index, which is what lets the 503-warming contract and
//! the `graph_pending` flag be covered by tests at all.
