// "worker" process per repo. Those workers hold a RocksDB lock AND keep the
// `context-engine-rs.exe` image open. A worker only self-exits after an idle
// window (default 300s), so if the router dies but its workers linger, the next
// `npx osxsystem-context-engine@latest` cannot replace the cached binary and npm
// fails with `EPERM: operation not permitted, unlink ...context-engine-rs.exe`.
//
// On Windows there is no real SIGINT to forward: Node's `child.kill('SIGINT')`
// maps to TerminateProcess, which kills ONLY the router and leaves the workers
// orphaned. So on Windows we kill the whole tree with `taskkill /T /F` (the
// router is still alive when we snapshot, so its workers are in the tree). On
// POSIX we forward the real signal to the child, which the router handles to
// kill its workers before exiting. The binary's Job Object (Windows
// kill-on-close) remains the backstop for anything either path races past.
